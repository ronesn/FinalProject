FinalProject
============

Final project @Shenkar collage 
T
he ultimate goal of the project is to build vehicles to track another vehicle .
You can break it to some destinations :
The first part is essentially rendering  (Image processing) :
Identifying vehicles in space, its distance from us, and the exact location .
For this purpose we used the library Open CV (Open Source Computer Vision ( is a software package
Designed to help develop applications of computer vision . Mainly oriented library for vision applications
Computer in real time.
In the second part , after identifying the exact location of the vehicle in front, to decide whether we want to follow
Followed and if so which way just contact .
These data processing is done in the code C++
Another major goal is control of the hardware itself and the interface with the software :
Reading data from the camera , after data processing " speech " software with Physical components , and finally moving
Vehicle itself precisely by our needs .
We used a network camera connects directly to a computer . Computer transmits the commands for movement Miko
Visit (Microcontroller ) . Microcontroller is a small single integrated circuit containing a processor core ,
Memory and peripheral I / O programmable . Mikrovkrim designed for embedded applications . Mikrovkrim
Are used in most electronic products around us . Lmikaovkrim low power consumption
Significantly .
Hmikrovkr himself was connected to another driver for controlling the motors . Device received
Mhmikrovkr three stress under which he controlled two motors. DC motor engine that promotes or inhibits the
Car . And sign on magnetic motor carried out for us the steering
